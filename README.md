# URL Shortner Service
This is a URL shorten service I created as a side project. Used Express for the server and 
EJS as the templating engine with mongodb as the database.

### Run Locally
- Install the project folder
- Run `npm init`
- Go on `localhost:7000` to see the project

### Things to do
[x] Basic Service is done
[ ] Improve the UI
[ ] Push the project on Heroku
